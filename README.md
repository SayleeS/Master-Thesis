# Master-Thesis
The integration of Augmented Reality in various industries has seen a rise in the past couple of
years. Today AR is used on a large scale for data visualization. It offer several benefits such as
immersion in the data and improved presentation over the traditional methods such as using a
desktop computer. In this master thesis, we focus on the impact that AR data visualizations have on
the decision-making abilities of the user. We want to explore how the user’s understanding of the
data is affected when it is presented in AR. Further, we also want to study the idea of having Data
on the Go where the data follows the user at all times. This has the advantage of giving live updates
to the user when they are on the move. We want to evaluate the performance of the users in taking a
decision when they are observing the data in AR and at the same time completing a secondary task
of walking.
We have adopted the use case of medical data for our visualizations. To prepare for this we conducted
several interviews with medical staff to understand what kind of data is important for analysing
the health of a patient. We also conducted an exploratory user study where the participants played
the role of a doctor in a hospital. We presented the participants with four unique use cases where
they had to take important decisions about a patient’s health withing a time limit. The data was
presented to the participants in 2 formats: on the HoloLens and the computer. We compared these
two conditions in terms of the accuracy of the decisions, time needed and preferences of the different
participants.
Based on our user study we believe that the decision-making capabilities of a user remains unaffected
irrespective of which method they are using. For time critical situations the user can swiftly reach
a decision in both the cases and for non-emergency situations the time based performance of the
HoloLens is better as compared to the computer. Based on the subjective feedback we received, we
believe that, the Data on the Go scenario has a lot of potential if the movement and orientation of
the data is improved.
